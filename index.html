    <h1>Slaanesh</h1>

    <h2>Birth of the Dark Prince</h2>
    <p>
      Slaanesh, also known as the Dark Prince, the Prince of Pleasure, the Lord
      of Excess, the Perfect Prince, and even the Prince of Chaos in the
      Imperium of Man, is the Chaos God of pleasure, excess and decadence. Lust,
      pride and self-indulgence are the hallmarks of all who follow it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slaanesh is the youngest of the four major Chaos Gods, having come to full
      sentience within the Immaterium only during the 30th Millennium. While
      generally referred to as a "he" by Humans and as a female by the Aeldari,
      Slaanesh is actually neither gender, combining characteristics of both and
      perfecting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slaanesh typically appears in an androgynous form in which it is a woman
      on the right side and a man on the left with two sets of devilish horns
      growing from its head. Slaanesh can assume any physical form; male,
      female, both at the same time or no gender at all, but it prefers male
      bodies. Its sacred number is six and the colours associated with Slaanesh
      are purple, pink and black.
    </p>
    <h2>Rivalry</h2>
    <p>
      Slaanesh is said to have little interest in the other Chaos Powers, being
      too caught up in its own pleasures to be interested in alliances or
      co-operation. However, the followers of Khorne with their boorish beliefs
      in bloodshed for its own sake are particular enemies. Cults dedicated to
      Khorne and Slaanesh clash frequently in the mortal realm just as their
      daemonic legions are believed to battle endlessly in the Realm of Chaos.
    </p>
    <h3>Chaos Gods</h3>
    <p>
      As this is a realm of thought, a coalescence of extreme emotion often
      yields the birth of a sinister Warp entity. The strongest of these
      entities are the Chaos Gods, Khorne (a god of rage, bloodshed, and war),
      Nurgle (a god of despair, decay and pestilent disease), Tzeentch (a god of
      change, deception, scheming, sorcery, and, oddly enough, hope) and
      Slaanesh (a god of pleasure, pain, depravity, pride and decadence).
    </p>
    <p>
      The gods of Chaos are the result of the strongest impulses in the living
      souls of the universe's sentient inhabitants. Their cults have a dynamic
      and antagonistic relationship. Khorne opposes Slaanesh, while Nurgle
      opposes Tzeentch.
